# HackerNews
In this project, we are going to conduct a quick analysis on the dataset of Hacker News Posts.
We are interested in the following questions:
Do Ask posts or Show posts receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

In conclusion, the ask posts receive more comments on average than show posts and this might be due to people like to answer questions and share their thoughts. 
The result shows that if you post ask posts at 15:00, your posts have higher chances to receive more comments on average.
